Sure, I won't include the actual code, but I can guide you on how to structure your Flask application for user authentication and provide insights into each step.

### Project Structure and Overview

1. **User Model (`user.py`)**:
   - Define a SQLAlchemy model named `User` with attributes like `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `session_id`, and `reset_token`.

2. **Database Class (`db.py`)**:
   - Implement the `DB` class which manages interactions with the database.
   - Provide methods like `add_user`, `find_user_by`, and `update_user` to handle user operations using SQLAlchemy.

3. **Authentication Class (`auth.py`)**:
   - Create the `Auth` class to manage authentication operations.
   - Implement methods like `register_user`, `valid_login`, `create_session`, `destroy_session`, `get_user_from_session_id`, `get_reset_password_token`, `update_password`, etc.
   - Utilize `bcrypt` for password hashing and session management.

4. **Flask Application (`app.py`)**:
   - Set up a basic Flask app with routes for:
     - `/` - Welcome message.
     - `/users` - Register new users using form data (`email` and `password`).
     - `/sessions` - Handle user login using form data (`email` and `password`).
     - `/profile` - Retrieve user profile details using session ID cookie.
     - `/reset_password` - Initiate password reset using form data (`email`).

5. **Routes Implementation**:
   - Implement route handlers that interact with the `Auth` class methods.
   - Handle HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) appropriately for each route.
   - Use Flask's `request` object to retrieve form data and cookies, and `jsonify` to return JSON responses.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling for various scenarios such as invalid credentials, duplicate user registrations, unauthorized access, etc.
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (`200`, `400`, `401`, `403`) along with informative JSON payloads.

7. **Testing**:
   - Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of your application.
   - Use tools like `curl` or Python's `requests` library to simulate requests and validate responses.
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered, including error scenarios.

### Tips for Implementation

- **Flask Basics**: Familiarize yourself with Flask's request handling, routing, and response mechanisms.
- **Security**: Implement secure practices such as password hashing, session management with UUIDs, and error handling to prevent information leakage.
- **Database Interaction**: Use SQLAlchemy for database operations and ensure to follow best practices like session management and error handling.
- **Code Structure**: Maintain clean and modular code with appropriate separation of concerns between the model (`user.py`), database (`db.py`), authentication (`auth.py`), and application (`app.py`) layers.
- **Documentation**: Ensure each module, class, and method has clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test each endpoint to ensure correct behavior under normal and edge cases.
